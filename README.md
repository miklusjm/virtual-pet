WCCI Virtual Pet Project

This project is a simple virtual pet game developed out of anticipation for the upcoming games Pokémon Sun & Moon. You get to go on an adventure with any of the three starter Pokémon from Sun & Moon.

Gameplay includes RPG-style combat against any of three types of wild Pokémon from Sun & Moon. Your monster's abilities will do super-effective damage if you use the proper type. Get stronger if you win the match, but don't let your Pokémon faint. You can also train your Pokémon with a timing game, or just take a day off and see what happens. Don't forget to manage your inventory well as you'll need that to keep your monster in fighting shape.

TODO

(I probably won't do these unless there is an assignment to add onto this, but these are things that came to mind.)

Include ASCII art of each Pokémon.
Switch enemy Pokémon generation to a class instead of in the main method.
Standardize methods ("Press any key to continue" ALWAYS or NEVER in methods, console positioning, etc.)
Let you catch Pokémon, of course.
